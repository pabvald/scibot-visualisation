<p rating="false">Camp David: Sanctuary for Presidents </p>
<p answer="true">THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The midnight fog wreathed the oaks and maples at Camp David last week, turning headlights to silvery shimmers in the dense woods with only token power to cut through the mist.</p>
<p rating="false">Last week's fog made Camp David seem remote from the world. That's exactly what Franklin Roosevelt had in mind in 1942 when he named the place Shangri-La and began to use it as a sanctuary less than two hours' drive from the pressures of wartime Washington.</p>
<p rating="false">Americans had made James Hilton's 1933 novel, "Lost Horizons," a best seller, then a popular movie. Thus, they knew "Shangri-La" as a mountainous Asian eden "where all the fret of existence had ebbed away."</p>
<p rating="false">In 1942, reporters wanted to know where the U.S. warplanes that raided Tokyo had flown from. "From our secret base in Shangri-La," Roosevelt replied.</p>
<p rating="false">The Roosevelt Shangri-La, a 143-acre rough-and-ready camp rather hidden in the trees, has always offered presidents that sense of escape and worry-free repose. </p>
