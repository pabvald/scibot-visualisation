<p answer="true">BATH, N.H. (AP) -- The year was 1946 when Jack Rael came to Tulsa, Okla., for a one-nighter with a Chicago band, checked into his hotel room and flicked on the radio.</p>
<p rating="false">Clara Ann Fowler, 18, of nearby Claremore, happened to be doing her 15-minute live show, and her singing caught Rael's attention. He immediately called the station, KTUL, and asked Fowler if she had ever thought of leaving Tulsa for the big time. No, she said, she wanted to be a commercial artist. He asked her to send him some sample records. She did, and less than eight weeks later she was opening in Chicago with the band for a six-week engagement.</p>
<p rating="false">Before the end of the 1940s, Clara Ann Fowler was on her way to becoming one of the greatest female pop singers of all time. By then, she was known as The Singing Rage, Miss Patti Page.</p>
<p rating="false">The waltz was on the charts for 30 weeks, 12 of them in the top 10, and eventually sold more than 10 million copies, behind only "White Christmas" by Bing Crosby at the time. Since then, Elton John's song about Princess Diana has taken over the top spot. </p>
