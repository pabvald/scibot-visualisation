<h1 question='true'>Who is the CEO of the United Parcel Service (UPS)? </h1>
<p rating="false">AFTER 92 YEARS, UPS PLANS STOCK OFFERING </p>
<p>NEW YORK -- Ever since two Seattle teen-agers started a telephone message service in 1907 that grew to become United Parcel Service of America Inc., the company, now the world's largest package delivery service, has been a rarity in corporate America.</p>
<p rating="false">Owned by its employees and managers, it is a company where many people spend their entire working lives. The company's top 15 executives all began their careers sorting packages. And even odder, for 92 years UPS has resisted the persistent entreaties of investment bankers and remained private.</p>
<p rating="false">But analysts also said that it was getting harder and harder for UPS to continue to turn its back on the soaring values investors are giving an Internet-related company. Last year, FDX shares soared 47 percent after investors identified it as a so-called Internet play.</p>
<p rating="false">Ralph Uriguen, who drives a tractor trailer at UPS and holds 1,500 shares after 12 years, said he also was reluctant to sell out. "UPS is a company that always turns a profit and only has room to grow." </p>
