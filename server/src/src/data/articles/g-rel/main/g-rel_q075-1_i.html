<p rating="false">GREENSPAN HINTS RATE CUT IS UNLIKELY </p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Wednesday there is little evidence that the economy is slowing. But he warned for the first time since the stock market's most recent run-up that equity prices might be getting excessive.</p>
<p rating="false">Greenspan's testimony marked something of a return to his customary views after the tumult of last fall, when the Fed cut interest rates by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point to calm anxious investors and insure that the financial upheaval that began in Asia did not spread to the U.S. economy. </p>
<p rating="false">Moreover, Greenspan said, central banks had to be careful that interest-rate changes did not unduly unsettle the financial markets, given their fragility. Policy makers, he said, "are going to have to be particularly wary of actions that unnecessarily sow uncertainties, undermine confidence and interfere with the efficient allocation of capital."  </p>
