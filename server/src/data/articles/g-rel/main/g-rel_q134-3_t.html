<h1 question='true'>What is a genome? </h1>
<p rating="false">FIRM FACES LAST LEG OF HUMAN GENOME PROJECT </p>
<p>The Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md., said Monday it was about to begin the final stage in its project to decode the human genome.</p>
<p rating="false">The two sets of data will be assembled independently, he said, because of possibly differing levels of accuracy. Celera is sequencing the DNA of a single anonymous man (males are genomically more interesting because they have both an X and a Y chromosome; females only X's) while the public consortium is sequencing a mosaic genome in which different segments come from different anonymous individuals.</p>
<p rating="false">Many academic biologists would doubtless prefer having their own free data base than having to depend on Celera's largesse. Also, much of the interest of the human genome is likely to lie not in the sequence which is common to all humans but in the DNA sites where individuals have a unit that differs from the consensus sequence. It is these variations, known as SNP's, for single nucleotide polymorphisms, that make each individual unique and are the basis for a projected new drug system known as pharmacogenomics.  </p>
