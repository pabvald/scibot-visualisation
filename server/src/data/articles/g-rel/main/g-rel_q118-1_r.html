<p answer="true">WASHINGTON -- It's getting tougher to be a hero in today's military. Of course, the Pentagon still hands out plenty of Purple Hearts and Bronze Stars. But the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest honor, has been awarded only twice for valorous action since the Vietnam War: to two Army sergeants killed in Somalia in 1993 as they tried to help wounded comrades.</p>
<p rating="false">When the Congressional Medal of Honor Society meets this weekend in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., more than half of the 163 living recipients are expected to attend. Since 1863, 3,399 people have received the award, including one woman, Mary Walker, a Civil War surgeon from Oswego, N.Y.</p>
<p rating="false">While Pentagon officials insist the stringent requirements in the statutes have not changed, some retired brass fear politics has colored the selection process recently. There was even some surprise at the Pentagon when President Clinton and Congress approved the awards for the sergeants killed in Somalia. </p>
