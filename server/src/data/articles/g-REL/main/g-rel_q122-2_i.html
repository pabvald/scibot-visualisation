<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- With Hurricane Georges, the most powerful storm of the season, bearing down on them Sunday with 135-mile-per-hour winds, Puerto Rico and a dozen smaller Caribbean islands south and east of here braced for what authorities warned could become a disaster.</p>
<p rating="false">At a news conference here Sunday afternoon, Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency, warning the 3.8 million residents of this American commonwealth that the hurricane represented "a moment of crisis." Rossello said that although "our people are better prepared than on previous occasions," the magnitude of the storm required that the population act "with the utmost seriousness" and take extra precautions.</p>
<p rating="false">"For the third time in four years, we are facing a major hurricane," Lester Bird, prime minister of the twin-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, warned in a radio address to his country's 65,000 citizens. Antigua was hit by Luis in 1995 and Bertha in 1996, and last summer had to accommodate refugees from a volcanic eruption that severely damaged the neighboring island of Montserrat. </p>
