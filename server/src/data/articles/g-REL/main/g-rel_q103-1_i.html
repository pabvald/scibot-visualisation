<p>ORLANDO, Fla. -- This year's hurricane season in the Atlantic is likely to be "very active" with a chance of damaging storms striking Florida and the East Coast, a leading hurricane forecaster said Friday.</p>
<p rating="false">From 1995 to 1998, there were 33 hurricanes a record for a four-year period. That could signal a return to a cycle of high hurricane activity that lasts two or three decades, scientists at the meeting said. The last such cycle was seen in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p rating="false">Jerry Jarrell, the director of the center, also urged Florida to do something about "the Key West problem," including the construction of a four-lane highway all the way from Key West. When Hurricane Georges, a Category II storm, struck last October, 30,000 people elected to stay on the Florida Keys. Computer models show that in a Category IV storm, Key West would be underwater, Jarrell said. "We would have massive casualties," he said. </p>
