<p answer="true">VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC was unable to reach unanimous agreement Tuesday on raising oil production to stabilize prices, an Iranian delegate said. But in a rare departure from its consensus approach, ministers were expected to approve a plan to boost output by as much as 7 percent, even without Iran's participation.</p>
<p rating="false">An official statement was awaited to explain the action after a six-hour meeting at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna. Delegates spoke on condition of anonymity as the meeting broke up.</p>
<p rating="false">Iran entered the meeting as the main holdout to a proposal to raise production by 1.7 million barrels per day beginning April 1.</p>
<p rating="false">The United States, the world's biggest consumer of oil, has gone to exceptional lengths to lobby the cartel to raise production. Alarmed at the tripling of oil prices during the past 12 months, the U.S. government has said that an increase of 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day is needed to replenish depleted inventories and satisfy growing world demand. </p>
