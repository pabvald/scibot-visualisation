<h1 question='true'>What is the title of the Counting Crows signature hit? </h1>
<p rating="false">CROWS SOARING HIGH ON `LIFE' </p>
<p>It's the curse of being part of the supporting musical cast, as opposed to a band leader, and dates back to when big bands were named for frontmen like Tommy Dorsey and Harry James.</p>
<p rating="false">In rock, unless a player is a member of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones or the Spice Girls, he's just a supporting player. Some musicians can't take that sort of ego check and seek out their own above-the-marquee status - Geri Halliwell, Joey McIntyre and former Go Go Jane Wiedlin, for example.</p>
<p rating="false">For others, like Counting Crows guitarist Dan Vickrey, it's a blessing. This is a humble response, but if there was ever a case for band members getting the same recognition as their lead vocalist, it's Counting Crows.
<p rating="false">Since the group formed in 1990, Duritz has been providing grainy, winsome prose about people who are needed or in need. Without Vickrey's and David Bryson's guitars, Charles Gillingham's keyboards, and percussion by bassist Matt Malley and drummer Ben Mize, however, the words would be just poetry on the page. </p>
