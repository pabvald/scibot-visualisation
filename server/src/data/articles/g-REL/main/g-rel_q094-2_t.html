<p>WASHINGTON -- Susan McDougal, the embattled Whitewater figure who suffered incarceration rather than answer grand jury questions about Bill and Hillary Clinton, was unexpectedly ordered freed from prison by a federal judge in Little Rock.</p>
<p rating="false">Through her travail, Mrs. McDougal has maintained a combative resistance to Starr and his attempts to link the Clintons to criminal activity in the decade-old complex of real estate and political events known as Whitewater. She stood firm in leg irons and high heels as she was led off the first time for her silence and her supporters opened an Internet web site (www.stopstarr.org) that portrayed her as a martyr to prosecutorial zeal.</p>
<p rating="false">After her release, Mark Barrett, an associate independent counsel, emphasized that the government had offered no opposition to Mrs. McDougal's motion to be allowed her freedom on her own recognizance, pending her next contempt trial. </p>
