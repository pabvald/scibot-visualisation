<p answer="true">BLOOMINGTON, Minn. -- Jesse Ventura - former "bad boy" on the pro wrestling circuit, action-flick actor, Navy SEAL, and talk radio shock jock - says he's ready for a new nickname. He doesn't want to be called "the Body" any more. "I'm Jesse the Mind now," he said Wednesday.</p>
<p rating="false">"The Body" was born James George Janos, still his legal name, but he began to call himself Jesse Ventura at the start of his professional wrestling career in 1975. "Ventura" sounded like it fit the bleached-blond surfer-wrestler image he was cultivating after coming out of a stint as a Navy S.E.A.L in Vietnam.</p>
<p rating="false">"He wasn't really a very good wrestler, but he had charisma," said Dave Meltzer, publisher and editor of Wrestling Observer newsletter. "His best move was standing on the apron yelling at the fans while his tag team partner did all the work."</p>
<p rating="false">Ventura's breathtaking victory - with 37 percent of the vote - marked the first time a Reform Party candidate has ever won statewide office and makes him the highest ranking elected official in Ross Perot's party. </p>
